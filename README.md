This web app generates orbitals probabalistically from their wavefunctions and displays them using three.js to allow students to better visualize their geometry. It allows students to properly view orbitals in 3D space, and gives them the ability to rotate and translate them. The goal is to help them gain a better understanding of orbital shapes and how electron density is distributed in shells, improving chemistry education.
