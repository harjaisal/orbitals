This web app generates orbitals probabalistically from their wavefunctions and displays them using three.js to allow students to better visualize their geometry, improving chemistry education. It allows students to properly view orbitals, particularly those with large principal quantum numbers, and to rotate and translate them. This allows them to gain a better understanding of orbital shapes and how subshells interact with one another.
