This web app generates orbitals probabalistically from their wavefunctions and displays them using three.js to allow students to better visualize their geometry, with a goal of improving chemistry education. It allows students to properly view orbitals, and gives them the ability to rotate and translate them. This allows them to gain a better understanding of orbital shapes and how electron density is distributed in shells.
